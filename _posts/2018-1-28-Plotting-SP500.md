title: Plotting 500 largest american companies on the map
---

## Getting S&P 500 list of companies
In order to plot the data about 500 largest american companies on the map I need to get the list itself.
There were a few options: Yahoo Finance API, Google Finance, Morningstar, and the list goes on. 
However, the easiest way I've found is described in here: <https://datahub.io/core/s-and-p-500-companies>.

I wrote some code to download and parse csv file:
```python
def get_sp500(csvurl, print_output=True):
    r = requests.get(csvurl)
    f = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile('wb')
    f.write(r.content)

    with open(f.name, 'rt', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
        csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        tickers = []
        for row in csvreader:
            if print_output:
                print(', '.join(row))
            if row[0] != 'Symbol':
                tickers.append(row[0])
    f.close()
    return tickers
 ```

## Getting company location by ticker
This list from above contains stock ticker, company name and industry.

This data is enough to get information about company headquarters.

In order to do that, let's use Google Maps API.

I wrote a little helper in Python that get's a list of points from Gmaps API using their places api:
```python
def get_coordinates(query):
    query = query.replace(" ", "+")
    query = query.replace("&", "+")
    url = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/textsearch/json?query=" + query + "&key=" + apikey
    response = requests.get(url=url)
    responseObject = json.loads(response.text)
    if responseObject["status"] == "OK":
        try:
            return Location(address=responseObject["results"][0]["formatted_address"],
                    location=responseObject["results"][0]["geometry"]["location"])
        except:
            print(responseObject)
            return None
    print(responseObject["status"])
    return None
```

Let's look at an example from this API call:
```json
{
	"type": "Feature",
	"geometry": {
		"type": "Point",
		"coordinates": [34.0194543, -118.4911912]
	},
	"properties": {
		"mag": 54832332477,
		"companyName": "Activision Blizzard Inc",
		"address": "California, USA"
	}
}
```

As you can see, Activision Blizzard is headquartered in California, USA.

In some cases Google Maps API returns null, in this case the code returns None.

## Putting data on the map

Now that we have things like compnay name, it's coordinates and market capitalization it is time to plot all this data on the map.
In order to do this, I will use The Google Maps Data layer to display GeoJSON data on a map.
They have an extensive documemtation available, so let's jump to the code itself.
```javascript
function eqfeed_callback(results) {
        var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhttp.open("GET", "https://8db.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/stock/");
        xhttp.send();
        xhttp.onload = function() {
          var response = xhttp.response;
          var obj = JSON.parse(response);

          var maxMarketCap = 0;
          var features = [];
          for (var i = 0; i < obj.length; i++) {
            var feature = JSON.parse(obj[i].feature);
            var props = feature.properties;
            maxMarketCap = Math.max(maxMarketCap, props["mag"]);
            point = new google.maps.Data.Point({lat: feature.geometry.coordinates[0], lng: feature.geometry.coordinates[1]});
            feature = new google.maps.Data.Feature();
            feature.setGeometry(point);
            for (const prop in props) {
              feature.setProperty(prop, props[prop]);
            } 
            features.push(feature);
          }

          for (var i = 0; i < features.length; i++) {
            var normalizedMag = features[i].getProperty("mag") / maxMarketCap;
            features[i].setProperty("magnitude", normalizedMag);
            map.data.add(features[i]);
          }
        };
```

I've used AWS lambda as a server and DynamoDB to store location data.

The code snippet from above makes an HTTP GET request to the server, gets an array of [features](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/3.exp/reference#Data.Feature). A feature is a container that has an id, geometry and a set of properties. In this case geometry in a [point](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/3.exp/reference#Data.Point) and I have a property named `magnitude` that determines the size of the bubble on the map (bigger marker capitalization -> bigger bubble on the map). Also note that magnitude property is normalized - it's maximum value is 1.0. This is needed for scaling to make sure all the bubbles can be seen on the map.

## Putting it all together
The end result is available here: 
The data is updated daily. As you can see, the biggest companies are clustered in California and Washington. Not surprisingly, if we look at top 5 companies by marker cap: 
1. Apple (California)
2. Alphabet (California)
3. Amazon (Washington)
4. Microsoft (Washington)
5. Facebook (California)
